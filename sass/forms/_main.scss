/*
 *  Styling of form elements
 */

//Looked through all of these and made a few notes.
//TODO: Most seem just fine.  Still need to do a few things:
//Go through and make sure colors aren't hardcoded
//Check for transitions and pull out as variables
//Add some polish to the pickers, they're rough around the edges
