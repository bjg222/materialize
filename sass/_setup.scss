/*
 * To use Materialize with customizations, import this file first, then
 * set up your custom values for variables.  This allows you to use the
 * utility functions or mixins in your variables if needed, as well as
 * to tweak the color tables without needing to provide full tables from
 * scratch (if you set up your variables first, then just call the main
 * materialize file, you'd have to set up an entire color table rather
 * than just append to the existing one).
 *
 * So your style.scss file should look like:
 *
 * @import "materialize/setup";
 *
 * $define-your-variables: here;
 *
 * @import "materilaize/main";
 *
 * your {
 *   .custom-rules {
 *     go: here
 *   }
 * }
 *
